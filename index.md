# Argonaut Metadata Project

{% include figure.html img="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/images/argonaut_header.jpg" alt="The Argonaut (masthead)" %}

The [Argonaut Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/argonaut/) contains over 6,000 issues U of I's student newspaper since 1898.
A subject index was created by dedicated library staff over time to help people find interesting content in the collection.
However, more than 1,500 issues currently have no metadata.
*How sad!*

This Spring 2020 Project seeks to enhance the metadata to make the Argonaut archives more discoverable for All!
